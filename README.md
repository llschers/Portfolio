# Portfolio
A portfolio of my work.

These files are examples of projects I have completed for my Data Science Master's degree through Indiana University.
My resume can be found [here](https://github.iu.edu/llschers/Portfolio/blob/master/LeahScherschelResume10Sep2020.pdf).

## Course Work
### I535 Big Data Project B Report.pdf: 
The final project for the course Management, Access, and Use of Big and Complex Data at (IUB).

### SparkML_FinalProject.py: 
A Python file of my final project for the course Machine Learning in Spark at IUB.

### decision_tree_orientation_classifier.py: 
A Python program I wrote for the course Elements of Artificial Intelligence. It is a ML classifier that predicts the orientation of an image (0, 90, 180, 270).

## Data Visualization Client Project
### GephiNetwork.png: 
A snapshot of a visualization made in Gephi for Indiana University Bloomington's (IUB's) Environmental Resilience Institute (ERI).

### wordCloudScript.R: 
An R script file I wrote to create the word cloud image for IUB's ERI.

### RScriptWordCloud.png: 
A word cloud visualization I developed for IUB's ERI to showcase the diverse background of its affiliates.

## Capstone Project
### Leah_s_Capstone_Project_Report_Final.pdf:
My final capstone project report, which was completed under the mentorship of Katy Borner of the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS) and received a final grade of "A".
